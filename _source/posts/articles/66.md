We recently had the pleasure of welcoming [Peter Yeung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pete-yeung-80728721/) onto the design team as our Senior Communications Designer. Part of my job as Head of Design is ensuring that when people join the team they’re given a lovely experience day where they’re made to feel welcome and shown the ropes.
