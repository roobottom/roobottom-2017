A huge shaggy dog that would visit him for a while.</p><p>I really didn&#39;t know what depression meant, I always thought it was something people said when they were a bit sad about something. It wasn&#39;t until my first year at University that I felt the crushing grip of depression.</p><p>For those of you that don&#39;t know; depression isn&#39;t feeling a little sad. It&#39;s a deep dark pit of despair, it grips you like a vice, squeezing your stomach sending poison round your body. That first time at University was exactly this. I couldn&#39;t face doing anything. I didn&#39;t care what I looked like, I couldn&#39;t interact with people anymore, something had broken inside me and I didn&#39;t know what it was or how to make it better. Slowly, so slowly I came out of it. I floundered there for a while, but it did get better.</p><p>That was eight years ago. I remember for the longest time afterwards I was scared that It would come back, that the very act of being scared of it was going to cause it. Fear of fear itself. I&#39;ve had other bouts of it, mostly at University, but always come out the other side, perhaps a bit stronger for the experience.</p><p>That brings me to today. And I&#39;m feeling low again. I wouldn&#39;t say that I was depressed because I can remember that feeling, and that was a <em>lot</em> worse. This is sporadic, occasionally punching me in the stomach when I&#39;m least expecting it. I do know I&#39;ll get better. Past experience teaches me that I <em>probably</em> wont feel like this forever. I&#39;ve just got to keep telling myself that.</p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/13">Four Things</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/15">The Boosh!</a></div></nav></div></main><div class="c_fullscreen"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span> </a><a href="#" class="m_siteHeader__menuLink" title="Toggle the main menu"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_siteHeader__menuIcon m_icon--small" data-alt-icon="menu-close"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg></a></div><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--main"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--house m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#house"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--teacup m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#teacup"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--clipboard m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#clipboard"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern Library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></body></html>
