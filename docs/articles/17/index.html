          <p>I'm developing my site in the open, module by module, it will undoubtably have weird styling in lots of places. You can <a href="https://github.com/roobottom/roobottom-2017">view the source on Github.</a></p>
        </div> --><main class="c_page"><div class="c_page__content"><h1 class="m_pageTitle">These Things, I&#39;m Thankful For</h1><article class="m_prose"><p>We watched the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387131/">Constant Gardener</a> last Tuesday night, which Paul told me was called the Uphill Gardener so really didn't want to watch it. For those who haven't seen it, I really would recommend giving it a go, I'm not going to bother explaining the plot (you can read about it on imdb if you're really that interested) but suffice to say its set in Africa, and shows in no uncertain terms the sometimes brutal existence that people live.</p><p>The film catalysed me into writing about something I've been thinking about for the last few weeks: How privileged I am. When McClegg got back from India, he had lots of stories about the absolute poverty that people find themselves in. I can't even begin to imagine living that life, the gulf between my luxury existence and the hand-to-mouth living that many of this world's inhabitants endure is almost insurmountable. As the old saying goes...</p><blockquote><p>It could be worse</p></blockquote><p>...and yes indeed it could be a lot worse. So this got me thinking about &quot;accident&quot; of birth. Is it pure chance that you are born into the family and circumstances you have? Does God control it? If so, it may seem a little unfair that I'm enjoying my decadent life while there are people suffering all over the world from a variety of different evils. I guess we could look at the &quot;big&quot; picture and say that everyone is dying, and the only purpose of this life is to drive us closer to our maker / the answers / any other generic thing that we as a species seek on a day-to-day basis. I'll admit, I don't have the first idea.</p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/16">Jon&#39;s School Days</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/18">Genius</a></div></nav></div></main><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span> </a><a href="#" class="m_siteHeader__menuLink" title="Toggle the main menu"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_siteHeader__menuIcon m_icon--small" data-alt-icon="menu-close"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg></a></div><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--main"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--house m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#house"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--teacup m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#teacup"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--clipboard m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#clipboard"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><script src="/functionality.js"></script></body></html>
