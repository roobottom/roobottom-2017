The scenery is breathtaking and a road sign tells me it’s 27 degrees, perfect driving weather, if our air con still worked.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/41/alps.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Driving over the Alps"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Driving over the Alps</figcaption></figure><p>At this point we’ve covered 1,703 km and aside from a little smoke up some of the steeper sections of motorway our van is performing well. From our home in the south of England we took the tunnel from Dover to Calais, then to an overnight stop in northern France at <a href="http://www.campingmontdesbruyeres.com/english/">Saint-Amanda-les-eaux</a>.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/41/france.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Our first night at Camping des Bruyeres"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Our first night at Camping des Bruyeres</figcaption></figure><p>To be honest, it wasn’t the most spectacular campsite, but it was clean and spent a very pleasant evening drinking beer and watching some men playing boules, one of whom looked suspiciously like Paul Whitehouse.</p><p>Feeling bolstered by our success driving on the other side of the road, we decided to head for Baden-Baden and <a href="http://www.campingplatz-adam.de/">Camplingplatz Adam</a> the next day; a distance of just over 600km. Actually, the drive turned out to be pretty straight-forward aside from one incident when we somehow missed the road closed signs and found ourselves driving over freshly prepared gravel, workmen shaking their heads in disbelief as we passed.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/41/adam-night.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="The view from our van at Campingplatz Adam"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">The view from our van at Campingplatz Adam</figcaption></figure><p>We stayed in the beautiful campgrounds for three days, swimming in the lake and generally not doing much of anything. On the second day we managed to peel ourselves away and drove into Baden-Baden, where we partook of some very European things like eating outside and strolling along the promenade. Our Britishness didn’t like that very much and forced us onto the Dotto train so we’d feel more like tourists again. Phew.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/41/baden_lunch.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Lunch in Baden-Baden"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Lunch in Baden-Baden</figcaption></figure><p>Sad as we were to leave, Salzburg beckoned, so we packed up the van and set off. This was another sweaty drive along Euro-route 52. Six hours later we were lost in the city. In situations like this Katie stays calm and I tend to overreact (a little). Ahem. Anyway, luckily on this occasion Katie was behind the wheel and did a sterling job of navigating the 5pm traffic until we <em>finally</em> reached <a href="http://www.panorama-camping.at/cms/index.php?lang=en">Panorama Camping</a>.</p><p>Wow, what a site! Brilliant views and with WC and show blocks that wouldn’t have been out of place in a five-star hotel. It’s also here that I first discovered the local brew, Stiegl.</p><p>The next day (despite <em>really</em> enjoying the beer) we made an early start into Salzburg. I’d once been here on a school trip but the only thing I remember with any clarity was the McDonalds. Katie kept insisting that the hills were alive with the sound of music, but I wasn’t sure what she meant by this.</p><p>Arriving by bus into Mozartsteg we made our way through the square, past the stalls selling Bavarian hats and up the hill to the fortress Hohensalzburg. After exploring for a bit we sat, pretzel and beer in hand, admiring the stunning view over the mountains.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/41/salzburg.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Downtown Salzburg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Downtown Salzburg</figcaption></figure><p>Next, I discovered a little more about those musical hills with a Sound of Music themed bus tour of the city. I secretly really enjoyed this ride around the sights of the city made (even more) famous by the film. We ended our day with a plate of Snitzel at the Stiegl brewery restaurant with (yup, you guessed it) a refreshing cold beer.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/41/pavilion.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Katie outside the &quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen&quot; pavilion"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">Katie outside the &quot;Sixteen Going on Seventeen&quot; pavilion</figcaption></figure><p>Next is Lake Garda, it’s already hotter than Austria, so onto Italy!</p><p>To be continued…</p></article></div></div></main><section class="c_aside" role="complementary"><div class="c_aside__content"><div class="c_grid c_grid--single"><div class="m_cloud"><p class="m_cloud__title">Tagged:</p><ol class="m_cloud__items"><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/capervanning" title="View all content tagged capervanning"><span class="m_tag__name">capervanning</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/travel" title="View all content tagged travel"><span class="m_tag__name">travel</span></a></li></ol></div><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Previous article:</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/40">Sigur Ros at the Eden Project</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article:</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/42">European Adventure Week Two</a></div></nav></div></div></section><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu" style="display: none"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><header class="c_header"><div class="c_header__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span></a></div><a class="m_menuControl m_menuControl--open" href="#main-menu" data-fullscreen-close="#main-menu"><span class="m_menuControl__icon"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_icon--small"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg> </span><span class="m_menuControl__label">Close</span></a></div></header><main class="c_page"><div class="c_page__content"><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--chunky"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link" title="Home"><span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link m_navigation__link--current" title="Articles"><span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/tags" class="m_navigation__link" title="Tags"><span class="m_navigation__title">Tags</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link" title="Pattern library"><span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></main></div></div><script src="/loadlater.js"></script></body></html>
