So we set off: Four blokes, one van and Jayne (Chris' sat-nav lady friend) - Gripped, sorted, we were ready to off-road. The riding was good, nothing too challenging, just easy riding to ease us back in after the long winter.</p><p>So as we left for the pub about 5.30pm the sun was shining and all was right with the world. The meal was awesome, and spirits were high, so we decided that camping would actually be a <em>really</em> good idea. I knew of a camp-site, nothing special, but this was camping right? We'd got tents and sleeping bags, what more did we need? We set off, Jayne leading the way, the last of the warm spring sun disappearing behind the rolling hills.</p><p>About half way to the site, a few spots of gentle rain began to appear on the windscreen. We wiped them away. The closer we got; the rougher the roads became, the rain was now slightly more than a a gentle smattering, and we were starting to think this was a bad idea.</p><p>We finally arrived at <a href="http://www.peakdistrict.org/pubs/access4all/byne.htm">Eric Byne camp-site</a> it was dark, pissing down, and bloody cold. After trudging up and down the hill several times, even the trip to the pub didn't cheer us up much. All I can say is thank the Lord for Little Chef!</p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/1">Top 10</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/3">Back to the old school</a></div></nav></div></main><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span> </a><a href="#" class="m_siteHeader__menuLink" title="Toggle the main menu"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_siteHeader__menuIcon m_icon--small" data-alt-icon="menu-close"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg></a></div><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--main"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--house m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#house"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--teacup m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#teacup"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--clipboard m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#clipboard"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><script src="/functionality.js"></script></body></html>
