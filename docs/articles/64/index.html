A revelation even. If you’ve ever tried to do any interface design in software like Illustrator or Photoshop, then the power of Sketch and it’s symbols are like a thousand unicorns vomiting rainbows made of magical chocolate beans.</p><p>At Firefly, we’ve recently made the transitioned to Sketch specifically because of the power of symbols. These have enabled us to build our pattern library — a kit of reusable interface elements — in a way that helps us to do some extreemly rapid prototyping and create consistent experiences for our users.</p><p>I’d highly recommend you read <a href="https://abstractapp.com/2017/04/12/component-based-workflow-sketch.html">this excellent post</a> by Tim Van Damme on the way he’s using the power of Sketch symbols in an atomic-like design process. It expresses better than I ever could why Sketch symbols are so powerful, and how a modern design process should work.</p><h2>So, what’s the problem?</h2><p>As brilliant as Sketch symbols are, they don’t yet fully support our ideal workflow. When we set out to create our pattern library, we had a set of requirements, these were:</p><ol><li>Symbols are stored in a central location that is accessible by the whole team</li><li>Symbols are linked across files, updating a symbol in any file updates it everywhere</li><li>Editing clashes are handled in a nice way</li><li>Symbols can be organised into categories</li></ol><h2>What we’re currently doing</h2><p>Initially we experimented with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/craft">Craft</a> from inVision. It’s library functionality would allow us to store symbols in a central location, share them across the team. Most excitingly of all, symbols would be linked across files, meaning we could ensure we were always using the latest version in our designs.</p><p>Unfortunately, when it came to handling editing clashes, Craft did less well. We lost an entire week of work due to our library file becoming corrupted. We were told that this was a known issue, and the file was unrecoverable. We decided not to entrust our entire pattern library to Craft, there was no way we could risk that happening again.</p><hr><p><strong>Plan b: House our library in a single sketch file.</strong> Some smart organisation of the dartboards on the symbols pages meant we could <em>kind of</em> categorise symbols. This means we can zoom out and quickly find the symbol we’re looking for, without polluting the symbol name with the category.</p><figure class="m_figure m_figure--pull-both"><a href="/images/articles/64/categorising-symbols.png" class="m_figure__link"><img src="/images/articles/64/categorising-symbols.png" class="m_figure__image" alt="A contrived example of how were using layout and labels to categorise the symbols page in Sketch"></a><figcaption class="m_figure__caption">A contrived example of how were using layout and labels to categorise the symbols page in Sketch</figcaption></figure><p>[something about the structure we’re using? /!constructions, etc]</p><p>A downside to this solution was that editing clashes weren’t handled, at all. Rather, whoever saved the file last would overwrite work of anyone else. Thankfully, <a href="https://abstractapp.com/">Abstract</a> came to our rescue.</p><p>The team has been using Abstract for version management of Sketch files for the last few weeks, and what a difference it’s made! Once you have the git mental modal in your head, Abstract’s workflow makes a lot of sense. We can now branch off the mater pattern library document, make our changes, and merge back. Clashes are handled visually, giving you the choice of which symbol definition to keep.</p><p>Abstract also allows for in context design reviews from within the app.</p><p>We now have three out of four of our original requirements. We’re almost there! But what about linking symbols across files?</p><h2>A native solution?</h2><p>I’d argue that level of complexity represented by shared symbols in Sketch requires a native solution. Plugins, like Craft, will only ever be a poly-fill at best.</p><p>Looking at the features that Bohemian have added to Sketch over the last few versions, I strongly suspect that they’re already working on some sort of shared symbols. It’s a natural fit for them, they already have the cloud infrastructure with Sketch Cloud and with their new open JSON formatted files, it seems like this might be the next logical step.</p></article></div></div></main><section class="c_aside" role="complementary"><div class="c_aside__content"><div class="c_grid c_grid--prose"><div class="m_cloud"><p class="m_cloud__title">Tagged:</p><ol class="m_cloud__items"><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/pattern-libraries" title="View all content tagged pattern libraries"><span class="m_tag__name">pattern libraries</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/leading-design" title="View all content tagged leading design"><span class="m_tag__name">leading design</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/sketchapp" title="View all content tagged sketchapp"><span class="m_tag__name">sketchapp</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/abstractapp" title="View all content tagged abstractapp"><span class="m_tag__name">abstractapp</span></a></li><li class="m_cloud__item"><a class="m_tag" href="/tags/firefly" title="View all content tagged firefly"><span class="m_tag__name">firefly</span></a></li></ol></div><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/63">Tuscany with a toddler</a></div></nav></div></div></section><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu" style="display: none"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><header class="c_header"><div class="c_header__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span></a></div><a class="m_menuControl m_menuControl--open" href="#main-menu" data-fullscreen-close="#main-menu"><span class="m_menuControl__icon"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_icon--small"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg> </span><span class="m_menuControl__label">Close</span></a></div></header><main class="c_page"><div class="c_page__content"><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--chunky"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link" title="Home"><span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link m_navigation__link--current" title="Articles"><span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/tags" class="m_navigation__link" title="Tags"><span class="m_navigation__title">Tags</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link" title="Pattern library"><span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></main></div></div><script src="/loadlater.js"></script></body></html>
