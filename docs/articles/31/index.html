The Bible says…</p><blockquote><p>If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</p></blockquote><p>Well, as a basic statement of faith I believe that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life of all humanity. He has given me abundant life, and given me new hope. When I returned from University in 2003, I was not a believer. In fact I cringed in embarrassment the one and only time I did make it to church. ‘What are these nutters doing?’ I thought, as all around me people we’re raising their arm and singing at the top of their voices in praise to their King.</p><p>And then I went along again to church, for a friends wedding blessing. Again, at first, I was an awkward affair. I didn’t feel comfortable around these people making fools of themselves. But, right there in the middle of the midst of my embarrassment and endless questioning, God met me. I can describe this experience as nothing less than an amazing filling of God, the Holy Spirit. Things that I’d pushed right down, things I didn’t want to think about burst into my mind. The deep black endless pit of depression that I’d suffered with the previous five years was suddenly at the forefront of my mind. But there was something else, something much bigger than that; an overwhelming Joy.</p><p>Tears streamed down my face as I too now worshiped God who’d given me this wonderful gift. It was a lightbulb moment, a sudden realisation that where I once thought there was nothing, there was indeed something. From that day I went looking for God. It wasn’t like I had that experience and that was it, I had to actively seek him out, read the Bible and spend time with Him.</p></article></main><hr><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/30">You know you&#39;re living in a shared house when</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/32">My love hate relationship with O2</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
