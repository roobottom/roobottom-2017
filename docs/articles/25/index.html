Unfortunately, we&#39;re up against it as Walsall Council in their wisdom have decided to stop charging us the £20 per week rent we used to pay and increase it to £100! How nice of them. Obviously the KK needs to keep going, so any fundraising ideas (or indeed donations) are gratefully received.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/25/473616523_54bbc19737_o.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Hannah painting the boards" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-26-1-473616523_54bbc19737_o.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-26-1-473616523_54bbc19737_o.jpg">Hannah painting the boards</span></figcaption></figure><p>I put together the original design in good old Fireworks, the design was then transferred onto the boards using a combination of bits of string, pencils and one massive ruler. Hannah then got to work painting.</p><p>The finished thing (although not quite the same as the original) turned out alright. Dee provided some laminate stickers for the <a href="http://www.the4points.com/">4 points</a> (which looked awesome, thanks Dee).</p><p>Photos of the whole process are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roobottom/sets/72157600133942448/">this way...</a></p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/24">Glaxstar</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/26">Pimp My Attitude</a></div></nav></div></main></body></html>
