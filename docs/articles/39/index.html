I&#39;d also started freelancing, launching roodesign around the same time.</p><p>That was twelve years ago when I was slightly shorter in the tooth and smaller of belly and working for myself, eventually making the move down south, starting full-time in London. All this rather took up my time and thoughts of a personal web project went the same way as oh-so-many pies.</p><p>But a man can dream, and dream I did: first of a CSS3 wonderland with garish colours and effects galore. Then, deciding that blogs were entirely too much hassle, of a stark Neverland consisting purely of some witty paragraph of text and a few links to social networks I hated.</p><p>Eventually I went back to basics and fleshed out exactly what I wanted: Somewhere to write the occasional blog post, showcase my work and post my photographs.</p><p>##Firm foundations I built my first website because it was fun. I then got a job making websites, again because it was enjoyable. I&#39;m lucky that I get paid for what is essentially a hobby. I think that makes me a &quot;professional&quot; but the jury is still out on that one.</p><p>So <em>this</em> site should be the most fun of all, right? I decided to abandon any highfalutin design ideas and just stick to a few core principals that would allow me to grow this site organically.</p><p>First was the logo. I&#39;d been sketching some ideas around a typographic &quot;roo&quot; for a while. A kangaroo was also an obvious choice. The final result is the emblem you see at the top of this page. Not perfect by any means, but a good starting point. I&#39;ll no doubt change it as the site grows.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/39/book.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Some early concepts for the roo logo " aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-37-1-book.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-37-1-book.jpg">Some early concepts for the roo logo</span></figcaption></figure><p>Secondly to start with core elements then work out from there. Creating a pleasant and easy-to-use website is key to this idea, but it&#39;s more than that. By letting the content do the work and keeping the design as subtle as possible I&#39;m striving for (but probably rarely achieving) a browsing experience that feels effortless.</p><p>I&#39;ve chosen <a href="http://getkirby.com/">Kirby</a> as my <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, this has so far proven to be the perfect fit, allowing me to write content in the fantastic <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a> using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> so I always start with uncluttered, unformatted text.</p><p>And finally, stop procrastination and just launch the bloody thing! I&#39;ve spent entirely too many late nights debugging css to wait any longer. It&#39;s a personal project that&#39;ll grow. So here it is, warts and all.</p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/38">Snowdonia Slateman Triathlon</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/40">Sigur Ros at the Eden Project</a></div></nav></div></main><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span> </a><a href="#" class="m_siteHeader__menuLink" title="Toggle the main menu"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_siteHeader__menuIcon m_icon--small" data-alt-icon="menu-close"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg></a></div><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--main"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--house m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#house"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--teacup m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#teacup"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--clipboard m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#clipboard"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></body></html>
