As you may imagine, I was chuffed to bits to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roobottom/1798830018/">meet little Amelie</a> - she’s gorgeous and despite myself I think I actually said &quot;Awwww&quot;. I quickly had to talk about football to regain some equilibrium (not that I like football - it was just the first manly thing that came to mind).</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/28/1798830018_93c0be6e2b_o.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="The day I met Amelie" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-20-1-1798830018_93c0be6e2b_o.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-20-1-1798830018_93c0be6e2b_o.jpg">The day I met Amelie</span></figcaption></figure><p>But seriously, she is amazing - even if she is making Katie broodier than ever. I was not so pleased to be asked to take back my gift though! I mean, come on, what self-respecting parent wouldn’t want Baby smokes-a-lot around to teach their kid at an early age that smoking is not only sociably acceptable, but also makes you look cool. I’m surprised this little guy hasn’t got a pair of gnarly shades or far out tattered jeans - Just look how cool he looks puffing away on that big tab.</p><p>Well done proud parents - I bet you can’t wait to see what I get her for Christmas!</p></article></main><hr><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/27">Lake Garda, Italy</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/29">Glubble Family Edition</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
