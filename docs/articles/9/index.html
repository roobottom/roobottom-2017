Let&#39;s say for example that you commented on someones <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos, and six months later you fly out to Spain to visit them. Well, funnily enough (cue sincere laughter) that&#39;s exactly what happened to me.</p><p>Madrid was awesome, and a good time was had by all. We saw castles, bars, mountains, bars, shops, bars, trains, planes and automobiles. Oh, and bars. But all this got me thinking up until I&#39;d actually spent more than one afternoon with Liz I&#39;d been feeling a little... seedy about meeting someone over the internet. Maybe that&#39;s not the right word, but my limited vocabulary doesn&#39;t allow me to be any more descriptive.</p><p>I&#39;m sure you know what I mean, &#39;meeting&#39; people via the internet does have a certain stigma attached to it. I&#39;m very happy to say in this case my new friend (who I&#39;ve firmly move up from &#39;flickr friend&#39; status) turned out to be awesome.</p></article></main><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/8">Cow Assassins</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/10">An Arresting Situation</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
