Let’s say for example that you commented on someones <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> photos, and six months later you fly out to Spain to visit them. Well, funnily enough (cue sincere laughter) that’s exactly what happened to me.</p><p>Madrid was awesome, and a good time was had by all. We saw castles, bars, mountains, bars, shops, bars, trains, planes and automobiles. Oh, and bars. But all this got me thinking up until I’d actually spent more than one afternoon with Liz I’d been feeling a little… seedy about meeting someone over the internet. Maybe that’s not the right word, but my limited vocabulary doesn’t allow me to be any more descriptive.</p><p>I’m sure you know what I mean, ‘meeting’ people via the internet does have a certain stigma attached to it. I’m very happy to say in this case my new friend (who I’ve firmly move up from ‘flickr friend’ status) turned out to be awesome.</p></article></main><hr><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/8">Cow Assassins</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/10">An Arresting Situation</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
