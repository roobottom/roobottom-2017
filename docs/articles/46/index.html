The reason for this flurry of activity was three new themes we’d be working for the big launch at the Firefly Learning Conference.</p><p>There’s a <a href="http://fireflylearning.com/blog/firefly-learning-conference-round-up">full writeup</a> on the Firefly blog, but I wanted to share a little about the process of creating the new themes that we hope will give students, teachers and parents an improved experience while using Firefly.</p><p>Since the launch of Firefly 5 last year, we’ve learnt a lot from our clients about what worked for them and what didn’t. We’ve also worked with some fantastic schools, creating bespoke themes, which gave us a wealth of ideas of the features students and teachers really want.</p><p>Using this feedback, we were able to distill a clear list of the <em>type</em> of themes schools wanted, along with the customisation options that would appeal. We determined to build three new themes: One a playful, friendly theme; Another, clean and succinct; Lastly, a super minimalist theme.</p><p>When I joined, just over three years ago, Firefly were five people crammed into a small office hidden away in a dark corner of One Lyric Square. The design department consisted of me and a pack of half empty Sharpies. Today we’re a forty strong team, with three (soon to be four) designers, with our own office in sunny Brighton. Over the summer holidays we were joined by intern <a href="http://www.adammmarsh.com">Adam Marsh</a> and, with his help, we set about designing the new themes.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/46/Firefly.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="The partners Joe &amp; Simon and (some of) the design team at the Firefly Learning Conference 2014" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-94-1-Firefly.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-94-1-Firefly.jpg">The partners Joe &amp; Simon and (some of) the design team at the Firefly Learning Conference 2014</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’m really proud of the hard work the entire team put in creating the new themes. This is just the start, we’re planning a number of upgrades to these themes as well as several new themes in the coming months.</p><p>You can see all the Firefly themes at <a href="http://themes.fireflylearning.com">themes.fireflylearning.com</a>.</p></article></main><hr><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/45">A brand new Roo</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/47">Project 365 2015</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
