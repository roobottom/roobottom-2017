It&#39;s a brilliant place, especially the rainforest biome which had really grown since our previous visit.</p><p>As a venue it really succeeds. It&#39;s a beautiful setting and the unique atmosphere really adds to the music. It&#39;s also really well run with helpful stewards a token system for drinks that means there&#39;s never a queue at the bar. Someone really know what they&#39;re doing.</p><p>We arrived late, just in time to grab a beer and some food and catch the start of <a href="http://www.ohdaughter.com/">Daughter</a> who were great. They&#39;re really melodic and boy she can sing, well worth a watch if you get the chance.</p><p>Eden is built at the bottom of an old quarry; the walls of which now team with plant life. By the time Sigur Ros took to the stage it was dusk and strings of fairly lights twinkled in the tress.</p><p>On stage, smoke filled the space as the band and their 11-piece orchestra started their set. The full-width monitor displayed a bizarre array of images as we were treated to what I can only describe as a wall-of-sound the band had built in front of the stage.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/40/sigur_ros_1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Sigur Ros and their amazing light show" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-38-1-sigur_ros_1.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-38-1-sigur_ros_1.jpg">Sigur Ros and their amazing light show</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was perfect. The venue and the atmosphere just worked so well. The light show too was spectacular. Lasers and smoke galore. I don&#39;t mean to gush, but it really was one of the best gigs I&#39;d ever been too. I was absolutely blown away by the band, his voice, the weird instruments and that sound. Oh, that brilliant sound.</p></article></main><hr><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/39">A New Website</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/41">European Adventure Week One</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
