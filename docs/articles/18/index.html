I’d almost forgotten the genius that was Ross’ “Corona Fighting” until he e-mailed it to me the other day.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/18/corona.jpg" class="m_figure__image"></figure><p>Everything about this game out classed the rest of our efforts (except maybe Huggies Coconut Stall - that thing was class). The sights, the sounds! The thrills, the spills! This is the ultimate panda fighting game, forget your Street Fighters, the future is here.</p><p>You can <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/downloads/ross_game/game1.html">play the game</a> (you may have to click on the actual game window before you fight) or <a href="http://www.roobottom.com/downloads/ross_game/introduction.html">watch the introduction</a>. The keys you say? Well, simply use the arrow keys to move left and right and jump, and to kick some ass use Q and A. Old skool. I’m expecting to be inundated with comments with this one. It’s amazing!</p></article></main><hr><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/17">These Things, I&#39;m Thankful For</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/19">Kings Bromley&#39;s Burning</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
