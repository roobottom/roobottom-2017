It being the season of University mates birthday’s (including mine - which is today by the way, just in case you wanted to send me that spare Ferrari you don’t use any more), I headed up to Huddersfield.</p><p>The night started out in traditional style with pizza-pie and vodka then continued the trend with a trip to Session, Vox, Sharkeys and then I’m sure there was more, but I know we did end up in the new noodle bar, which was nice (despite me voting for Lazeez, again).
