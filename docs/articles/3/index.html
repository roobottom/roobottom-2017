It being the season of University mates birthday’s (including mine - which is today by the way, just in case you wanted to send me that spare Ferrari you don’t use any more), I headed up to Huddersfield.</p><p>The night started out in traditional style with pizza-pie and vodka then continued the trend with a trip to Session, Vox, Sharkeys and then I’m sure there was more, but I know we did end up in the new noodle bar, which was nice (despite me voting for Lazeez, again). It was awesome to see the lads again, and kinda made me pine for the good old days of finishing work at 4.30 in the afternoon and getting home at 3 in the morning having only stopped off for a “quick pint” in Vox.</p><p>But I guess you get older and move on… back to Brownhills… <em>Damn</em>.</p><p>The rest of the weekend consisted of sitting around at Riks watching movies and eating yet more junk food.
