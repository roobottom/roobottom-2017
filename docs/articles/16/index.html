Yeah, I was a bit nervous but also dead excited to be out of the office and having fun with a bunch of kids all day.</p><p>Some of you will know that it&#39;s crossed my mind to go do teacher training in September, so wanted to see what it was all about before I signed up to anything. It&#39;s weird seeing one of your friends tech a bunch of 8 and 9 year old, to me it doesn&#39;t seem all that long ago that I was their age. I was really impressed with the way she controlled the class, and the obvious affection the kids had for her.</p><p>I&#39;ve got to say, teachers work damn hard. They work their collective asses off. Which is a bit of a sticking point for me. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m adverse to a bit of hard work (ahem) but quite a lot of the paperwork seems so unnecessary. I can&#39;t imagine anyone becoming a teacher unless they had a passion for working with kids, and the government seems to be squashing this by putting undue pressure on hard working school staff. I&#39;m not really ruling out teaching as a possibility, but I&#39;ve spoken to entirely too many people in the profession that are bitter about the workload.</p><p>I dunno, we&#39;ll see. It&#39;d be good to check out a few more schools (and years) first I think. The best bit of the day for me was thirty-five manic kids singing me the bumblebee song. Awesome!</p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/15">The Boosh!</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/17">These Things, I&#39;m Thankful For</a></div></nav></div></main><div class="c_fullscreen"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span> </a><a href="#" class="m_siteHeader__menuLink" title="Toggle the main menu"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_siteHeader__menuIcon m_icon--small" data-alt-icon="menu-close"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg></a></div><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--main"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--house m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#house"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--teacup m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#teacup"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--clipboard m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#clipboard"></use></svg> <span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern Library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div></body></html>
