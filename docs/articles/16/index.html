Yeah, I was a bit nervous but also dead excited to be out of the office and having fun with a bunch of kids all day.</p><p>Some of you will know that it’s crossed my mind to go do teacher training in September, so wanted to see what it was all about before I signed up to anything. It’s weird seeing one of your friends tech a bunch of 8 and 9 year old, to me it doesn’t seem all that long ago that I was their age. I was really impressed with the way she controlled the class, and the obvious affection the kids had for her.</p><p>I’ve got to say, teachers work damn hard. They work their collective asses off. Which is a bit of a sticking point for me. It’s not that I’m adverse to a bit of hard work (ahem) but quite a lot of the paperwork seems so unnecessary. I can’t imagine anyone becoming a teacher unless they had a passion for working with kids, and the government seems to be squashing this by putting undue pressure on hard working school staff. I’m not really ruling out teaching as a possibility, but I’ve spoken to entirely too many people in the profession that are bitter about the workload.</p><p>I dunno, we’ll see. It’d be good to check out a few more schools (and years) first I think. The best bit of the day for me was thirty-five manic kids singing me the bumblebee song. Awesome!</p></article></main><hr><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/15">The Boosh!</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/17">These Things, I&#39;m Thankful For</a></div></nav></div></body></html>
