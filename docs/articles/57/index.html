It was great! It had a gated pool, and all the toys the child could ever want. It was also close to beaches, restaurants and interesting places to visit.</p><p>The weather was a bit of a mixed bag, we had a few nice days, but if you like it hot (Like I do) then mid-October isn‚Äôt really the time to visit Portugal. It certainly wasn‚Äôt warm enough to heat the solar-powered pool heater. I went in a few times, but it was too cold for Katie and <em>Roo</em>.</p><h2>Striking a balance</h2><p>Every now and again I have a moment where it dawns on me that we have a child now, and our lives will never be the same again. Our first family holiday was one of those moments. Gone were the late night meals-out and morning lay-ins of holidays gone by. We could no longer plan days out that consisted purely of thing that Katie and I wanted to do. We had a little head to consider.</p><h2>Things we liked</h2><p>I think we managed to strike a balance, and found activities that we all enjoyed. <em>Roo</em> (for the most part) was happy to go with the flow, and enjoyed exploring new places.</p><p>Here‚Äôs some of the things we liked in and around Caldas da Rainha.</p><h3>Food</h3><p>The Portuguese all seemed to love children, so made eating out at lunch extremely easy. There were excellent restaurants almost everywhere we went, but a personal favourite was the vegetarian restaurant <a href="http://maratona.tv/">Maratona</a> in the centre of Caldas. They were brilliant with <em>Roo</em>, rushing through an order of chips to prevent the inevitable mealtime meltdown.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/57/maratona-1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Lovely food at the Maratona Caf√©" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-32-1-maratona-1.jpg"> <img src="/images/articles/57/maratona-2.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Cheeky chops" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-12-2-maratona-2.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionPreface">From first to last: </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-32-1-maratona-1.jpg">Lovely food at the Maratona Caf√©</span> <span class="m_figure__captionPunctuation">and </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-12-2-maratona-2.jpg">Cheeky chops</span></figcaption></figure><h3>Exploring</h3><p>We were delighted to find that <em>Roo</em> didn‚Äôt mind mooching around villages and towns. She was fascinated by the shops full of (mainly tile-based) gifts. As long as she was fed and could enjoy the occasional ice cream she was happy.</p><p>The monastery at Alboba√ßa was a particular favourite, with it‚Äôs large stone rooms. She loved hearing her footsteps and voice echoing down the corridors, <em>‚Äúecho, Mummy!‚Äù</em></p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/57/albobaca.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Exploring the monastery at Alboba√ßa" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-35-1-albobaca.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-35-1-albobaca.jpg">Exploring the monastery at Alboba√ßa</span></figcaption></figure><p>We also really liked √ìbidos, a fortified city that dates back to the 13th century. She loved the shops, castle and ice cream. We loved exploring the castle walls, the wonderful weather and the local cherry liqueur that you drink from a chocolate cup.</p><h3>Lisbon Oceanarium</h3><p>She <em>loved</em> the Oceanarium in Lisbon. We did have to queue a little for tickets (top tip: book online before you go) but the efficient staff meant our wait was fairly short.</p><p>I would love to know what she was thinking as she stared up at the double-floor height tank full, packed to the <em>gills</em> with all kind of fish. Its difficult to know what goes through that little head, but she chatted about <em>‚Äúfsh‚Äù</em> all the way back to the Villa.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/57/oceanarium-1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Loves a fish, this one" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-22-1-oceanarium-1.jpg"> <img src="/images/articles/57/oceanarium-2.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Lisbon Oceanarium" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-17-2-oceanarium-2.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionPreface">From first to last: </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-22-1-oceanarium-1.jpg">Loves a fish, this one</span> <span class="m_figure__captionPunctuation">and </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-17-2-oceanarium-2.jpg">Lisbon Oceanarium</span></figcaption></figure><h3>Buddha Eden</h3><p>The Buddha Eden in Bombarral is an amazing place. Set in 30 acres of beautiful gardens are hundreds of sculptures from all over Asia. <em>Roo</em> loved the wide open spaces and all the huge sculptures. There‚Äôs also some well times caf√©s where we were able to refuel while <em>Roo</em> had a sleep in her push-chair.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/57/buddha-1.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="The Buddha Eden in Bombarral" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-28-1-buddha-1.jpg"> <img src="/images/articles/57/buddha-2.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="Posing for the camera at the Buddha Eden in Bombarral" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-53-2-buddha-2.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionPreface">From first to last: </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-28-1-buddha-1.jpg">The Buddha Eden in Bombarral</span> <span class="m_figure__captionPunctuation">and </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-53-2-buddha-2.jpg">Posing for the camera at the Buddha Eden in Bombarral</span></figcaption></figure><h3>Beaches, parks and gardens</h3><p>Besides all the things we paid money for, there were plenty of free things that we enjoyed too. There is a beautiful park in Caldas that was a big hit with <em>Roo</em>, full of amazing green spaces, a lovely play-park and a couple of nice caf√©s.</p><p>There‚Äôs also some really great beaches in this area, which were deserted when we visited, it being so late in the year. The sea was freezing, but that didn‚Äôt stop <em>Roo</em> enjoying a paddle.</p><figure class="m_figure"><img src="/images/articles/57/park.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="In the park in Caldas da Rainha" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-31-1-park.jpg"> <img src="/images/articles/57/beach.jpg" class="m_figure__image" alt="On the beach" aria-labelledby="m_figure__caption-12-2-beach.jpg"><figcaption class="m_figure__caption"><span class="m_figure__captionPreface">From first to last: </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-31-1-park.jpg">In the park in Caldas da Rainha</span> <span class="m_figure__captionPunctuation">and </span><span class="m_figure__captionTitle" id="m_figure__caption-12-2-beach.jpg">On the beach</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Things we didn‚Äôt like as much</h2><p>The flight home was a bit rubbish. We‚Äôd stayed in a hotel at the airport the night before, but hadn‚Äôt really thought through the night sharing a room with <em>Roo</em>. So, between a disturbed night in a strange room and the 4:30am start to get our early flight its fair to say that <em>Roo</em> wasn‚Äôt in the best of moods.</p><p>Halfway home, in order to placate our struggling child, Katie had taken her on a walk down the isle to visit the cabin crew. While there she decided to vomit over the side of the plane and several unsuspecting passengers. Tiredness had gotten the better of her.</p><h2>In summary</h2><p>We had a brilliant time in Portugal, we‚Äôd thoroughly recommend it as a holiday destination with a small child. It was different, for sure, but I think we made it work, and made some more happy memories with the <em>Roo</em>.</p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><div class="m_prevNext__icons m_prevNext__icons--prev" aria-hidden="true"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--hand-point-left m_prevNext__hand--prev"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#hand-point-left"></use></svg> <svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--arm m_prevNext__arm--prev"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#arm"></use></svg></div><p class="m_prevNext__label">Previous article:</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/56">Common threads from Leading Design Conference 2016</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><div class="m_prevNext__icons m_prevNext__icons--next" aria-hidden="true"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--arm m_prevNext__arm--next"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#arm"></use></svg> <svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--hand-point-right m_prevNext__hand--next"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#hand-point-right"></use></svg></div><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article:</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/58">I made some Christmas cards</a></div></nav></nav></div></main><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span> </a><a href="#" class="m_siteHeader__menuLink" title="Toggle the main menu" data-fullscreen-close="#main-menu"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_siteHeader__menuIcon m_icon--small" data-alt-icon="menu-close"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg></a></div><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--main"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--house m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#house"></use></svg> <a href="/" class="m_navigation__link" title="Home"><span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--teacup m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#teacup"></use></svg> <a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link" title="Articles"><span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--clipboard m_navigation__icon"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#clipboard"></use></svg> <a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link" title="Pattern library"><span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li></ul></nav><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--inline-bleached"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--github m_navigation__icon m_icon--x-small"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#github"></use></svg> <a href="https://github.com/roobottom" class="m_navigation__link" title="Github"><span class="m_navigation__title">Github</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--twitter m_navigation__icon m_icon--x-small"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#twitter"></use></svg> <a href="https://twitter.com/roobottom" class="m_navigation__link" title="Twitter"><span class="m_navigation__title">Twitter</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></div><script src="/functionality.js"></script></body></html>
