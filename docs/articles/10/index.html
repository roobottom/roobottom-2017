Which meant I had one small bottle of larger. Apparently on the journey home I failed to indicate at an island, so was merrily pulled over, blue light&#39;s-a-flashing. To be fair the two officers were very nice about the whole thing, and I kinda felt sorry for them wasting their time on me and a mountain of paperwork, still not the most pleasant way to end your night. Guess it&#39;s taught me a lesson though... Don&#39;t drink and drive. At all. Not a drop.</p></article><nav class="m_prevNext"><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--prev"><p class="m_prevNext__label">&larr; Previous article</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/9">The Rain in Spain</a></div><div class="m_prevNext__item m_prevNext__item--next"><p class="m_prevNext__label">Next article &rarr;</p><a class="m_prevNext__link" href="/articles/11">My Spritual Home?</a></div></nav></div></main></body></html>
