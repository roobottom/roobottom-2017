Maybe you went off to university, or maybe you took a more vocational route into a design job. However it happened, I’m sure, like me, you had an idealised view of what a job in design would be.</p><p>The reality is that your job probably isn’t everything you’d hoped. Sure there <em>is</em> creativity, but there’s an awful lot more grunt work than you’d bargained for.</p><p>This is especially true if you’re a web or app designer. Creating a constant experience means that once you’ve created a system for the interface, you shouldn’t deviate too far from this, or risk the user getting lost or confused. However, this can lead to rather a lot of <em>cut and paste</em> on the part of the designer who has to design each screen and state.</p><p>As Head of Design, it’s part of my role to create space for creativity.</p><h2>Making the switch to Sketch</h2><p>Recently we’ve been making <em>the big switch</em>, from Adobe Illustrator to <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>. This has given us the opportunity to reevaluate our design pattern library, as we have had to rebuild it in Sketch.</p><p>We had several problems with the Illustrator based pattern library that we wanted to fix, namely:</p><ul><li>Our design team did an amazing job, but there was <strong>no plan</strong> of what we wanted to build before we started building it. Ergo, we ended up with a confusing bunch of documents containing a mix of interface elements.</li><li>There was no reliable way of telling which components were out of date.</li><li>There were some repeated elements, that were subtly different from one another, and no way to tell which on to use in a new design.</li><li>There was little parity between the design patterns and the front-end pattern library. Each time a new screen was implemented, design patterns had to be translated into front-end patterns. Most of this knowledge lived only inside developers heads. This was bad.</li></ul><h2>This time we had a plan</h2><h2>How Sketch symbols help us stay sane</h2><h2>A swing, and a miss</h2><p>Imagine a utopia where you can</p></article></div></div></main><div class="c_fullscreen" id="main-menu" style="display: none"><div class="c_fullscreen__content"><header class="c_header"><div class="c_header__content"><div class="m_siteHeader"><a href="/" class="m_siteHeader__titleLink" title="Go to the homepage"><span class="m_siteHeader__intro">The personal website of</span> <span class="m_siteHeader__name">Jon Roobottom</span></a></div><a class="m_menuControl m_menuControl--open" href="#main-menu" data-fullscreen-close="#main-menu"><span class="m_menuControl__icon"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="m_icon m_icon--menu-close m_icon--small"><use xlink:href="/assets/sprites.svg#menu-close"></use></svg> </span><span class="m_menuControl__label">Close</span></a></div></header><main class="c_page"><div class="c_page__content"><nav class="m_navigation m_navigation--chunky"><ul class="m_navigation__items"><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/" class="m_navigation__link" title="Home"><span class="m_navigation__title">Home</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/articles" class="m_navigation__link" title="Articles"><span class="m_navigation__title">Articles</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/tags" class="m_navigation__link m_navigation__link--current" title="Tags"><span class="m_navigation__title">Tags</span></a></li><li class="m_navigation__item"><a href="/patterns" class="m_navigation__link" title="Pattern library"><span class="m_navigation__title">Pattern library</span></a></li></ul></nav></div></main></div></div><script src="/loadlater.js"></script></body></html>
